       <p>Hi! My name is Chloe and I'm 16 years old! 
         I live on the East coast of the United States
         and I really love learning new things! I'm a
         programmer who aspires to become a game developer.
         I love cats, music, books, crocheting, and of 
         course, playing video games!
      </p>


    <h3>My Hobbies</h3>

    <p>I have many hobbies: reading, crocheting, playing piano, programming, learning, playing video games, listening to music, etc etc.
    However, for some of my hobbies, I've won awards! Check those out on my <a href="portfolio.html" alt="Link to the portfolio page">portfolio page!</a></p>

Title: Chloe's Personal Website
Hours worked: ~5 hours

This was the first project I created in the Girls Who Code Pathways program in the web development course! It's a personal website, so it has my about me and some of my achievements.
I made it with HTML and CSS.

What I struggled with: I struggled with formatting the website because I didn't know much about flexbox at the time.
What I learned: This is the first website I ever made, so I learned a lot about the basics of HTML and CSS.

This repo doesn't have many commits because I made this in replit and didn't create any commits while making it.
